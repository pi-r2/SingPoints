This repository contains two folders:

code contains some sage and python code used to generate instances of a bihomogeneous polynomial system, the solutions of which are singular points of the variety defined by a public key of the UOV scheme. These instances may be solved with Gr√∂bner bases, and in particular we use msolve (https://github.com/algebraic-solving/msolve/).

logs details the result of running msolve on the input produced by our code.
