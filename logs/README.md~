This folder contains the logs of our experiments on UOV instances of varying sizes.

The name structure is as follows:

 - `bi<m>_<n>.ms` contains the polynomial system obtained from a public key for parameters q=251, m = `<m>`, n =` <n>`

 - `bi<m>_<n` contains the corresponding GrÃ¶bner basis

 - `bi<m>_<n>.log` contains the log file detailing the execution of F4 on the polynomial system through msolve.
